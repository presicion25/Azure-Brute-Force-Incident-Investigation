## Summary

In this project I work an incident in Azure Sentinel using log data ingested through the log analytics workspace. I use the NIST Incident Management Lifecycle, specifically the second step (Detection and Analysis), which has several sub-steps within it. Utilizing the investigation screen I demonstrate the entities involved and other incidents related to those entities. I am then able to close out the incident as a false positive and inject notes for future reference of similar incidents.

## Environments and Technologies Used

- Microsoft Azure
  - Log Analytics Workspace
  - Azure Sentinel (SIEM)
  - NIST Incident Management Lifecycle
 
- Notepad (for incident response notes)
- OBS Studio (for recording of the lab)
<br />
<br />

## Investigation View 

The below investigation screenshot display the entities involved in the brute force incident against the Windows VM I had deployed. Displayed are the alerts triggered, the attacking entity and related alerts. Off to the right is an information window displaying notes on the incident and notes with a link for further reference on the incident itself.

## Conclusion

In this project I was able to work an incident utilizing Azure Sentinel using the NIST Incident Management Lifecycle as a guide. The incident itself was a false positive, was noted as such and closed out. Azure Sentinel is a powerful security tool in the implementation of security controls in Azure.
